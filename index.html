                        <p>I miss everything about us — our old memories, the laughter, the smiles, the late-night calls, and all the little moments that meant so much. I truly loved spending time with you. Those moments will always be special to me.</p>

                        <p>I know things have changed, and maybe we both have too. I also know I made mistakes in the past, and I am truly sorry for them. At the time, I thought I could fix everything just by changing the present, but I realize now that the past still affects us in ways I didn't fully understand.</p>

                        <p>Today marks one year of our friendship, and even though the last few months haven't felt the same as before, I still cherish what we have shared. I miss you, and I want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always be here for you.</p>

                        <p class="signature">With love.</p>
